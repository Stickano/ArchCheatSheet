====== Agent ======
Created onsdag 23 november 2016

**An SSH agent will cache your private-key, so it can be provided to other SSH clients (Git etc). **
//ssh-agent//** is the default agent included with OpenSSH.**

**# Zsh!**
**# There is a plugin in OMZ, that allows you to easily run a SSH-agent at startup. See **Zsh**.**

===== Bash =====
**# Below is Bash specific - Zsh has a SSH agent plugin (or is it Oh-My-Zsh? Who cares)**

== Run the agent ==
$ eval $(ssh-agent)

== Add private key to agent ==
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh///<private-key>//

== To start the agent automatically ==
**# Add the following to your **//~/.bashrc//** file. **
**#** **This will also make sure, that only one instance of ssh-agent is running.**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
if ! pgrep -u $USER ssh-agent > /dev/null; then
	ssh-agent > ~/.ssh-agent
fi
if  "$SSH_AGENT_PID" == "" ; then
	eval $(<~/.ssh-agent)
fi
}}}
