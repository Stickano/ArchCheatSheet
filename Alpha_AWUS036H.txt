====== Alpha AWUS036H ======
Created Saturday 25 February 2017

**The Alpha AWUS036H, using the RTL8187L chipset, works out the box - but we are gonna tweak it a little for our needs.**

== Starting the Device ==
**# The device dosen't power up itself once plugged in. Power it up with**
**# Get the device name with**
$ iwconfig
**# OR**
$ ip link

**# In my example the card was named **//wlp0s20u2//
$ ip link set wlp0s20u2 up              

== Driver ==
**# We'll need a patched version of the driver**
$ yaourt -S backports-patches-git

== Promiscuous Mode ==
**# To have our monitors catch all packages, we'll need to put it in promiscuous mode**
**# Create a file in **///etc/systemd/system/promiscuous@.service //**with the following**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
[Unit]
Description=Set %i interface in promiscuous mode
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ip link set dev %i promisc on
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
}}}


**# Then you can Enable/Start Promiscuous Mode for a specific card (Change accordingly)**
$ systemctl start promiscuous@wlp0s20u3.service
