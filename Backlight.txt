====== Backlight ======
Created Thursday 23 February 2017

**Xbacklight should already be installed - it is part of the **//xorg-server-utils//** package.  Xbacklight does not remember the brightness over boots though, so we will fix that with a different package that uses ACPI controls instead - which is something systemd can remember across boots. We'll also install a package to dim the brightness on inactivity - not turning of the display, just dimming it. **

== Acpilight ==
**# Acpilight will make sure Xbacklight uses ACPI instead**
**# The **//xbacklight//** command stays - it is just an extended functionality**
$ yaourt -S acpilight

**# Put your user in the **//Video//** group**
$ gpasswd --add stick video

**# And create a file in **///etc/udev/rules.d/90-backlight.rules//** with the following **
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", ACTION=="add", \
  RUN+="/bin/chgrp video %S%p/brightness", \
  RUN+="/bin/chmod g+w %S%p/brightness"
}}}


**# Effects will take place after the next reboot. **


== Brightd ==
**# Brightd will dim the screen on inactivity **
$ yaourt -S brightd

**# Brightd is included in my **//xinitrc //**and settings are set to 60sec**
