====== Bluetooth ======
Created onsdag 28 december 2016

== Installation ==
**# Install the following packages**
$ pacman -S bluez bluez-utils

**# Modprobe the bluetooth driver**
$ modprobe btusb

**# Then start the bluetooth service whenever needed**
$ systemctl start bluetooth.service

===== Usage =====
**# Open the bluetooth interactive shell**
$ bluetoothctl

**# You can always run **//help//** in this shell, to list all commands^**

**# Power on the controller (off by default)**
$ power on

**# If the device is NOT already on your list, begin a scan**
$ scan on

**# To get a list of all your **registered** devices**
$ devices

**# Once you've found your device, pair it (You can **//<tab>//** complete)**
$ pair //<MAC_ADDRESS>//

**# If using a device without a PIN, trust the device to be able to reconnect**
$ trust //<MAC_ADDRESS>//

**# Then connect to the device**
$ connect //<MAC_ADDRESS>//


===== Troubleshoot =====
**# I've encountered quite a few issues with Bluetooth. Here's the fixes I've come about. **

== Not being able to power on the bluetooth device, or device not found in bluetoothctl ==
**# Failed to set power on: org.bluez.Error.Blocked (**//bluetoothctl//**)**
**# You can check and see, if the device is up/down**
$ hciconfig

**# And be able to turn the device on with **
$ hciconfig hci0 up

**# But you might get a '**//Can't init device hci0: Operation not possible due to RF-kill (132)//**'**
**# This means some software is blocking the device.. Great**
**# We're be able to check further with **//rfkill//
**# **//rfkill//** is a package that can manage wireless devices**
$ pacman -S rfkill

**# Running **//rfkill//** might give you an output like this**
	0: hci0: Bluetooth
			Soft blocked: yes	**# soft-blocked.. Those bastards!**
			Hard blocked: no
	
**# Unblock it **
**# Note the index no. above, in this example it's 0 (zero)**
$ rfkill unblock 0
