**# There are a couple of different Governors, which will have impact on the systems performance**
**# These seems to be the most common Governor settings;**
	**# **//performance //**= Run the CPU at maximum frequency **
	**# **//powersave //**= Run the CPU at minimum frequency **
	**# **//ondemand//** = Scales the frequency dynamically according to the current load**

**# To activate a particular Governor, ex **//performance//
$ cpupower frequency-set -g performance
