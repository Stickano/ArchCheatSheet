Created l√∏rdag 22 oktober 2016

==== Cleaning the package cache ====
**# Pacman stores downloaded packages in** ///var/cache/pacman/pkg//	
**# and it does not remove these versions automatic.** 

**# To remove all cached versions of uninstalled packages**
$ paccache -ruk0

**#** **To remove remaining, installed, cache packages except for the most recent 2 versions**
$ paccache -rk 2


==== Removing orphans (unused packages) ====
**# To list packages no longer used** 
$ pacman -Qdt

**#** **To remove orphans**
$ pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)

**# If the above returns**  //error: no targets specified //**no orphans were found.** 


==== Old configuration files ====
**# You can manually go through folders and clean up old configuration files from uninstalled packages. **
**# Some typical destinations may be;**
	~/.config/
	~/.cache/ 
	~/.local/share/
	

==== Broken symlinks ====
**# Broken symlinks should be removed. **
**#** **To list all broken symlinks**
$ find . -type l -! -exec test -e {} \; -print


==== Review installed packages ====
**# Review a list of your installed packages - there might be some you don't use anymore^** 
$ pacman -Qet            **# List installed packages (not dependencies)**


==== Tips and Tricks ====
**# Some random Tips and Tricks**

== BeachBit ==
**# BleachBit can help you clean the system by removing unwanted files. **
**#** **Be careful though. I think this has caused issues for my **//Firefox//**, so I'd disable cleaning that when running.**
$ pacman -S bleachbit
