====== Cower ======
Created Wednesday 22 February 2017

**Cower will search and download packages from the AUR, which will include the **//PKGBUILD//** that we can use with **//makepkg//**. Cower is installed in the **//makepkg//** article. **

== Configuration ==
**# Cower configuration file can be found at Github and is read from **//~/.config/cower/config//


===== Usage =====
**# Cower works quite a lot like Pacman. **

== Searching ==
**# Search packages (space separated list)**
$ cower -s //<PACKAGE_NAME> <PACKAGE_NAME2>//

**# Or get information about a package **
$ cower -i //<PACKAGE_NAME>//

== Packages and Updates ==
**# My config (Github) will download all packages to **//~/makepkg/packages/// 
**# To download a package **
$ cower -d //<PACKAGE_NAME>//

**# To check for Updates**
$ cower -u

**# You can also download updates by passing the **//-d//** flag along**
$ cower -ud

== Updates (or large amount of packages) ==
**# Custom script and alias available to iterate through **//PKGBUILDS//** with the editor,**
**# and a function that can bulk install the downloaded updates.**

**# To view all the new **//PKGBUILDS//** in the **//Gvim//
$ cownew

**# Once you've gone through the PKGBUILDS, install them **
$ cowup

**# This can also be used if you just downloaded a lot of package from the AUR and would like**
**# to bulk install em - meaning; that this is not update specific, but that will most likely have the **
**# most use-cases. **
