====== DKMS ======
Created torsdag 22 december 2016

**Dynamic Kernel Module Support - handles rebuild of package modules residing outsite the kernel three.**
**This means, that modules will be rebuild when new kernels are installed - instead of waiting for maintainer to release new build.**

== Installation ==
$ pacman -S dkms

**# DKMS also need the headers for ALL the installed kernels. **
**# Let's assume you have the **//zen//** and **//lts//** kernels installed**
$ pacman -S linux-zen-headers linux-lts-headers

**# Only packages I've come along so far;**
**# Nvidia Driver**
$ pacman -S nvidia-dkms

**# VirtualBox**
$ pacman -S virtualbox-host-dkms
$ pacman -S virtualbox-guest-dkms


===== Usage =====
**# Doubt you'll ever invoke dkms in anything.**
**# You can see which DKMS packages you have installed though**
$ dkms status

**# To rebuild all modules on current kernel **
$ dkms autoinstall


===== Tips and Tricks =====
**# Though, again, probably never used, you can add DKMS auto-complete to your Shell**
**# Add the following to your **//.bashrc/.zshrc//** file.**
	source /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/dkms
