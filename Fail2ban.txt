====== Fail2ban ======
Created Friday 13 January 2017

**Fail2ban will help protect against brute force attacks, by adding the host to the IP-block list. This is done by adding rules to iptables. We'll also configure, so that a E-mail will be sent, whenever a host has been blocked. We'll added a little extra security to Fail2Ban**

== Installation ==
$ pacman -S fail2ban

**# Then enable the service**
$ systemctl enable fail2ban.service

===== Configuration =====
**# We'll add a little extra security**

== Allow full Read access ==
**# Which will also allow fail2ban to set firewall rules with iptables. **
**# Create a file in **///etc/systemd/system/fail2ban.service.d/capabilities.conf //**and add the following**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
[Service]
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH CAP_NET_ADMIN CAP_NET_RAW
}}}


== Jails ==
**# Jails are the configuration for Fail2ban**
**# It comes with paths/locations for some different distros - but not for Arch. **
**#** **The Fedora paths should work though.**
$ cp /etc/fail2ban/paths-fedora.conf /etc/fail2ban/paths-archlinux.conf

**# The default Jail configuration can be found at **///etc/fail2ban/jail.conf //**but this file should not be edited **
**# Instead, rules defined in the default Jail, can copied and defined to a separate file in **///etc/fail2ban/jail.d///

**# Make sure the Fedora paths has been copied **
**# Then create a file at **///etc/fail2ban/jail.d/jail.local//** and insert the following **
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
[INCLUDES]
before = paths-archlinux.conf
}}}


**# If you installed **//SSMTP//** as explained in **//Terminal (+shell)//**, add the following too for mail notifications **
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
[DEFAULT]
mta = mail
destemail = jeppesen@tutanota.com
}}}
