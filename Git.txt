====== Git ======
Created onsdag 23 november 2016

**A usual Git workflow goes something like : **
**#	Create a new project (will create an initial master branch)**
**#	Do some initial file/project creation (project)**
**#	Create a brance (git) and make changes/additions (project)**
**#** 	**Then commit those changes.**
**#	Merge the commits changes to the master branch**
**#	(Optional) Push to remote server (github)**

== Installation ==
**Install the **//git//** package along with **//aspell//** for spell-checking**

== Configuration ==
**# Name and E-mail**
$ git config --global user.name  "Henrik Jeppesen"
$ git config --global user.email "Jeppesen@tutanota.com"

**# Default editor (nano)**
$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"

**# Default push action (?)**
$ git config --global push.default simple


===== File Handling =====

== Create new repository ==
$ cd //<your_project>///
$ git init

== Adding files to the index three ==
**# Once you've created/modified some files, they need to be added to git's index tree. **
**# This will make git able to record changes in files and commit those changes.**
$ git add //file1 file2//

**# To add all files **
$ git add .        **# note the dot (.)**

**# This will record the state of the files. **
**#** If** files are later modified, run **//git add//** again to add a new version to the index.**

== Ignoring files ==
**# It is possible to create a list for files, which should not be included when running **//git add .//** 	(add all)**
**# Create a file in your git directory called 	**//.gitignore	//**and choose from the following (add-able)**

	# File I'll likely delete
	test-script
	
	# Ignore all .html files, except 'important.html'
	*.html
	!important.html
	
	# Ignore all files recursively in 'DoNotInclude'
	DoNotInclude/**


== Removing files ==
**# To remove one file**
$ git rm --cached //<filename>//

**# To remove all files**
$ git rm --cached -r .        **# note the dot (.)**

== Other file management options ==
**# Rename a file**
$ git mv //<oldname> <newname>//

**# List files **
$ git ls-files

===== Commit Changes =====
**# You should commit changes to a branch (See a little further down)**
**# Once changes/additions has been made, commit those changes. Commit often.**
**# **//a//** will add changes from all known files.**
**# If **m "message"** is exluded, the default text-editor will open, alowing you to add a long message instead.**
$ git commit -am "Short Message."

**# Change/edit the message for the last commit**
$ git commit --amend -m "Short Message."

===== View Changes =====
**# Between staging area and the working tree (commit to push)**
$ git diff

**# General overview of the changes**
$ git status

**# Hisory overview	**//-N//**	is the number of commits to include (numeric value)**
$ git log -p (-N)

===== Branches =====
**# Added features, or bug-fixes, is usually tested in Branches. **
**#** **Once the changes are as pleassed, they can be commited and then merged with the master (default)  branch.**

**# Create a branch	which name accurately reflects its purpose**
$ git branch //added-feature-addition//

**# List branches**
$ git branch

**# Switch branches**
$ git checkout //<branchname>//

**# Merge a branch to the master branch**
$ git checkout master
$ git merge //<branchname>//

**# Once done with a branch, delete it**
$ git branch -d //<branchname>//

===== Merge Conflicts =====
**# Whenever git isn't able to merge commits/branches together, you will have to solve the conflict yourself.**
**# Navigate to your project folder and run a **//git status//** for more information**
**# Open the file(s) that are in conflict - with your favorite editor of couruse!^**

**# The conflict will be marked within **//<<<< ===== >>>> //** markers.**
	<<<<<<< HEAD
		**# You local branch data**
	======
		**# Other branch data**
	>>>>>>> //branchname//
	
**# Decide and make the changes that is wanted/needed. Remove the markers as well. **
**# Once the document looks like you want it, stage the changes**
$ git add .	**# note the dot (.)**

**# Then commit the changes **
$ git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict."

===== Remote Repositories =====
**Remote locations, like Github, can work in collaboration with your local repository.**
**Add your **[[:Keys|SSH public key]]** to Github and run your **[[:Agent|SSH agent]]**.**

**In below examples the **///Stickano/hello-world //**Github account and repository is used.**
**The SSH connection to this account would be **ssh://git@github.com/Stickano/hello-world

== Clone a repository ==
**# Say you've created a new repository on Github**
**# Create a new folder for the dump**
$ mkdir ~///<foldername>//

**# Clone the repository**
$ git clone ssh://git@github.com/Stickano/hello-world //<foldername>//

**# This will also create a label (see below) for the original location. This label is called 	**//origin//

== Pull request ==
**# A pull request will download the latest changes from the remote repository, so you can merge it with your own.**
**# To fetch (download changes) and view the changes**
$ git fetch ssh://git@github.com/Stickano/hello-world master
$ git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD

**# To merge master branches**
**# Remember to **//checkout master//** branch if you aren't already on it.**
$ git merge FETCH_HEAD

== Push repository ==
**# Once your local master branch (this example) has merged changes, you can push (upload) to remote repository.**

**# To push the current branch to the remote repository, FIRST TIME use**
$ git push ssh://git@github.com/Stickano/hello-world //-u//

**# Since the clone tool create a **//origin//** label, it would often look like this (FIRST TIME)**
$ git push -u origin 

**# The **//-u//** option will record the location, so next time you just have to use**
$ git push

**# Push a specific branch to remote repository. The branch will be created in it doesn't exist remote.**
$ git push origin //<branchname>//

**# Push current branch to the same name on remote repository**
$ git push origin HEAD


== Label your remote repository ==
**# NOTE: If you cloned a repository, it has already been labelled 	**//origin//

**# We can label our frequent visited remote repositories, like Github, to a meaningfull name**
$ git remote add //<labelname> //ssh://git@github.com/Stickano/hello-world

**#** **Fetch a label**
$ git fetch //<labelname>//

**# Show difference between local master and remote master**
$ git log -p master..//<labelname>///master

**# To view which label is used for current repository**
$ git remote -v


===== Tips and Tricks =====

== Auto completion with Bash commands ==
**# To add auto-complete on Git commands in your terminal, add the following to your **//.bashrc//** file**
	source /usr/share/git/completion/git-completion.bash
