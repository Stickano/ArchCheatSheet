**# Updated Version : **https://github.com/Stickano/ArchCheatSheet

**## What is this?**
**#**
**# This will take you through the steps of getting a stable Arch installation**
**# It will help you configure and install additional packages, **
**#** **so that your system has a lot of additional features and usability.  **

**## What will be covered?**
**#**
**# Coming from the typical Desktops, I found myself missing many features in my daily workflow. **
**# In my quest for covering those features, I stumbled upon some new ones \o/**
**# This has been an attempt to mimic a full fledged Desktop - but tailored for my needs only. **
**#**
**# A lot of configuration is left out. This is because that the programs has been configured**
**# along the way. This also means, that a whole dotfile repository is waiting for you to abuse.**
**# The dotfile repository can be found at **https://github.com/Stickano/dotfiles
**# which a.a. covers configuration for i3, Vim, Zsh, Urxvt etc etc.**

**## That's quite objective. What are your daily needs and workflow then?**
**#**
**# I'm on a laptop. More specific, a Asus UX32LN.**
**# I am the only user of my computer. **
**# Like many other, I have my daily web routines. **
**# I want my media handled with ease - movies, pictures and music.**
**# I do a little web-development - and trying to expand development in general. **
**# I like the thought of a somewhat secure system - but it mostly has to handle itself. **
**# I too wanna be able to fire up Steam and launch a oldie but goldie from time to time.**
**# ..and then I apparently enjoys to play with my system a bit to much. **

**## What kind of guru are you?**
**#**
**# I am no power user at all. I found it to be great fun, to customize my system after the best **
**# of my understandings. A lot of Wikis and Documentations has been read - sleepless nights**
**# scavenging the web for tips and tricks and configuration guides - but I cannot stress it enough;**
**# I am no power user!  So please, don't take this Cheat Sheet to serious. **

**## Oh.. okay. So why then?**
**#**
**# This Cheat Sheet is made because I kept going through the Arch Wiki - over and over again. **
**# I've had a lot of failures. Done a lot of re-installs.**
**# At some point I figured that I wanted some place local, where I could quickly reference for**
**# installation, configuration or usage. **
**#**
**# A lot of good information is found at the Arch Wiki - So many goodies actually. **
**# It just became to time consuming in the end, to scavenge through the pages for the information**
**# that I needed. **


**# Don't put to much though in the arrangement with some of these items. **
**# It is part of my idea on what a fully functional system should act like. **
**#**
**# There might be hidden gems inside sections, that isn't noted from outside the articles.**
**# By this I mean, that even though the section says **//PulseAudio//** it also holds the configurations**
**# and additional packages needed to get it working with my Bluetooth Speaker. **
**# Tips and Tricks are frequent throughout this whole Cheat Sheet - and these Tips and Tricks**
**# are based more on logic connection, than defined in the Headline.**


===== System Base =====
**# The following section will help you through what I consider a bare minimum.**
**# Follow the below order for a somewhat painless and stable setup. **

**1) Arch Base Installation**
	[[Arch_Base]] 

**2 ) Network Connectivity **
	**Check out **//netctl//** in **//Network// 
	
**3 ) Create a new User**
	**Check out **//Users// //and Groups//** in **//Users// 
	
**4 ) Define some privileges for our newly created user**
	[[sudo]]
	
**5 ) Enable 32bit support **
	**Check out **//Mirros//** in**// Maintenance //

**6 ) Display Server (+xinit)**
	[[Xorg]] 
	
**7 ) Touchpad was mad out of the box - Configure it early**
	[[Touchpad]] 
	
**8 ) Stable everyday use kernel and Long Time Support **
	[[Kernels]]

**9 ) Nvidia Video Driver**
	[[DKMS]] 
	
**10 ) Intel Video Driver and extended Nvidia controls**
	[[Display_Driver]] 

**11 ) AUR Support (Unofficial Packages)**
	[[Yaourt]] 
	
**12 ) Window Manager**
	[[i3]] 


===== Extended System Functionality =====
**# Now we should have a workspace to navigate around on. Quick and Stable - yet so useless. **
**# We still need quite a few things, before it is what I'd consider robust system. **

**# These steps will help you further configure some obvious functionality.**
**# Most are additional packages that needs to be installed, but there is also a few**
**# pointers on configuring from the System Base. **

**# We are not using a Display Manager - Define a nice Welcome Message instead**
	[[Login]] 

**# Auto mount external devices (USB/HDD)**
	[[External Devices]] 

**# Display Power Management**
	[[Xset]] 

**# Keyboard - mainly Xbinkeys**
	[[Fn-key]] 

**# Additional Radio Device - used to stream audio to BT speaker**
	[[Bluetooth]] 

**# Sound - Covers bluetooth speaker too**
	[[Pulseaudio]] 

**# Scheduled Jobs - used by some packages throughout **
	[[Cron]] 

**# Desktop Notifications**
	[[Dunst]] 
	
**# Email Notifications - also provides the feature to send mails from the Terminal^**
	[[SSMTP]] 

**# Check these out too!**
	[[Additional_rather_useful_software]] 


===== Performance and Improvements on Wear Down =====
**# We are well away with our base setup. **
**# Before we start making our system useful for everyday jobs,**
**# we'll first improve some overall performance. **

**# Browser Performance**
	[[PSD_and_ASD]]

**# Hardware Specific **
	[[SSD]] 
	[[CPU]] 

**# Power Management**
	[[Laptop]] 


===== System Tools =====
**# Here are some of the everyday tools you will be working with - and some not so everyday. **
**# Much is installed by Arch Base, but there is a few additional packages and pointers. **

**# Some very low-level, yet good to know tools**
	[[Basic_Tools_and_General_Examples]]  
	[[ls]] (Output Explanation)
	[[sed]] (Text Manipulation)

**# Service Manager**
	[[Systemd]]
	
**# Package Manager**
	[[Pacman]] 
	
**# Pointers on Desktop Entries (Application default run options)**
	[[Desktop_Entries]]
	
**# Pointers on handling Kernel Modules**
	[[Kernel_Modules]] 
	
**# File Types default application (mime-types)**
	[[xdg-utils]] 
	 

===== Maintenance =====
**# Awesome. Now we got a fast and stable system - and we know how to manage the basics of it!**
**# Before we continue to all the additional user specific packages, let's first see how we can**
**# keep our system at its best even after a long time of abuse. **

**#** **Some of these steps needs to be configured just once - but is considered by the system to**
**# be maintained as you go. Other steps requires you to manually perform some maintenance **
**#** **actions from time to time.**

== Configure Once ==
**# Automatically Update Mirrors**
	[[Mirrors]]
 

== Revisit Frequently ==
**# When Upgrading Packages**
	[[Pacnew_and_Pacsave]] 
	
**# Cleaning the Filesystem - Pacman cache, Orphans, Old configurations, Broken symlinks**
	[[Clean_the_Filesystem]] 


== When Needed ==
**# Downgrade Kernels or Packages in case of problems**
	[[Downgrading]]


===== Users and Groups =====
**# Linux recommends you to have a User Account with limited privileges, so that you don't**
**# accidentally mess up the system. Users (including the root account) have their own **
**# privileges which defines read, write and execute for their own files and folders.**

**# Users can be placed in groups and privileges can then be defined for those groups. **
**# This gives a pretty dynamic way of handling privileges, both for users and their system-wide**
**# controls,  but also for your own personal files and how they should be handled by others. **
**# Users, Groups and Permissions are all explained in these steps. **

== Configure Once ==
**# Create a set of default User Directories**
	[[xdg_user_dirs]]


== Administrate ==
**# Manage Users and Groups**
	[[Users and Groups]]
	
**# Manage Permissions and some Explanation (drwx)**
	[[Permissions]]  
	

===== Network =====
**# More Network information can be found throughout. This is mainly based on management**
**# of your network connection. **

**#** **Being on a Laptop I am very depending on my WiFi to work. **
**# Ethernet, not so much. Both are covered (barely) in these steps though. **

**# I have found the commonly installed package Network Manager works sketchy on my system.**
**# It tends to leave my connectivity unstable, so this package is left out. Quite frankly I like **//netctl//
**# better anyways - Simple, more stable and really not that much of a hassle to set up. **

**# WiFi and Ethernet Management**
	[[netctl]] 


===== Getting Information =====
**# This section will (hopefully) help us getting the information we need to get further.**
**# Whether that information might be driver, kernel hardware, network or log information**
**# pointers can be found in this section.**

**#Some tips on getting Hardware information**
	[[Hardware]]

**# Logs, Kernel Modules, Drivers and Application information**
	[[Software]] 

**# Connectivity - Mainly **//ss//** network tool**
	[[Network]]
	
**# System Journal**
	[[journalctl]] 


===== Terminal (+shell) =====
**# Now let us begin with some of the fun stuff. I find myself staring in a terminal window**
**# even more often than I stare at the browser. It is such a powerful (and wonderful) tool**
**# that it needs a little extra caress.**

**# In this section we'll both extend its functionality and style it a little, to make it look 21th century. **

**# Extended functionality with Aliases and Functions**
	[[Aliases]]
	[[Functions]]

**# Zsh Shell** 
	[[Zsh]] 

**# Terminal **
	[[rxvt-unicode]]
	[[Xresources]] (a little out of category, but hey)

**# Terminal Wrapper**
	[[Gnu_Screen]] 

**# A little extra!**
	[[Additional_Terminal_Packages]] 
	[[Terminal_Keks]] (lolcat, fortune, cowsay)


===== Security =====
**# Security is a quite large subject. I like the idea of making it harder for whom ever might **
**# be trying to listen in though. Several security steps has been taken - but several more**
**# could probably be added. **

**# The Firewall steps will also take you through the steps of blocking IPs from a blocklist.**

**# Anti Virus**
	[[clamav]] 

**# Firewall**
	[[iptables]] 
	[[iptable_rules]] (25 common rules)
	[[ipset]] 
	[[Fail2ban]]

**# Security Audit**
	[[lynis]] 
	
**# Secure Browsing**
	[[Tor]]


===== Preferred Software =====
**# We've come a long way.**
**# Now let's look at some useful tools, so we can get on with our lives. **

**# I've found myself to fall more and more in love with the terminal. **
**# The more i play around in the terminal, the more I have wanted to move my everyday tools**
**# to the terminal. This is of course to have quickly access to as much as possible, through**
**# just one point of interest. **

**# This section has both GUI and CLI tools. **

== GUI Tools ==
**# Web Browser**
	[[Firefox]] 
	
**# Office Suite**
	[[LibreOffice]]

	[[Steam]] 


===== SSH =====
**# Having an old computer act as server (whatever its purpose), is a great use of old hardware**
**# and a great waste of valuable time! This section will help you communicate with that spoiled **
**# little time consumer. Oh joy!**

**# Having a SSH key grants you several other benefits though. Such as quickly and hazzle-free**
**# authentication when publishing to Github via Git. **

	[[nmap]] 

**# Network Packet Monitor**
	[[wireshark]] 


===== Key Binds =====
**# At this point I have no more configurations or packages to throw at you. **
**# Hope it was manageable. Bare in mind, that his was not actually meant to teach you**
**# the technical stuff, but rather how to quickly install, configure and a quick scope of it capabilities. **
**# Thank's for reading and happy tinkering.**

**# Phew, that sure was a lot of configuration. At this point we've already forgot what we are**
**# capable of. Good thing this section is a throwback section - covering only the most necessary **
**# handling. **
