====== Archlinux Cheat Sheet ======
Created l√∏rdag 22 oktober 2016

== Foreword ==
**# Author : Henrik ( Jeppesen@tutanota.com )**
**# Updated Version : **https://github.com/Stickano/ArchCheatSheet
**# Dotfile Repository : **https://github.com/Stickano/dotfiles

**## What this is**
**#**
**# This is my local Archlinux Cheat Sheet. **
**# It has been created so I would have a place where I could quickly reference **
**# for installation, configuration and some basic usage. **

**## What this is not**
**#**
**# Don't expect to get wiser on the technologies used in this Sheet. **
**# The explanation is often left out and only a quick, one-line note is followed with the steps.**
**# This is - if I have to be honest - probably not even a good reference point. **
**# I am by no mean a power user, so this Sheet is created of my best understandings and findings.**
**# There isn't to much configuration in this Sheet - this has been done along the way and the **
**# necessary configuration files can be found at my dotfile repository. **

**## Why this sheet was made**
**#**
**# I have been scavenging the same Wiki pages, over and over, from the Archlinux Wikipedia.**
**# At some point I decided to have just the information I needed, at a local and easy accessible **
**# location. I have for many years used the traditional Desktop Environments, but when I wanted**
**# to try something new - in this case i3 Window Manager - I decided to document my steps from **
**# a fresh installation. As said, coming from the typical DEs I found myself missing a lot of the **
**# traditional features found in such environments, features that I had come to rely on **
**#** **in my everyday workflow. Therefore, this has also been an attempt to mimic some of the**
**# traditional features found in a fully fledged Desktop Environment - but suited for my personal**
**# needs.**

**## What the focus is on**
**#**
**# This setup is done on a Asus UX32NL Laptop.**
**# Everyday tasks - web, media etc - had to run smoothly.**
**# I do a little web-development, so there's some focus on that too. **
**# I like the idea of a somewhat secure system - but it has to manage itself. **
**# Fast, responsive and optimized for everyday use and work related tasks.  **

**# You will find a better overview (index-tree), of what this Cheat Sheet contains**
**# at the sheets Github page. Best of luck and happy tinkering \o**

===== System Base =====
**# The following section will help you through what I consider a bare minimum.**
**# Follow the below order for a somewhat painless and stable setup. **

**1) Arch Base Installation**

**2 ) Network Connectivity **
	**Check out **//netctl//** in **//Network// 
	
**3 ) Create a new User**
	**Check out **//Users// //and Groups//** in **//Users// 
	
**4 ) Define some privileges for our newly created user**
	[[sudo]]

**4.5 ) Consider installing Git and cloning Dotfile and CheatSheet repository**
	Make it a matter of copypasta!
		
**5 ) Enable 32bit support **
	**Check out **//Mirrors//** in**// Maintenance //

**6 ) Display Server (+xinit)**

===== Extended System Functionality =====
**# Now we should have a workspace to navigate around on. Quick and Stable - yet so useless. **
**# We still need quite a few things, before it is what I'd consider robust system. **
