===== .bashrc =====
Resides in ~/.bashrc	Below can be added to the .bashrc file for preferred configuration. 

== Disable logging of identical commands : ==
	export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups


== Search official repositories when a command was invalid : ==
**This requires the pkgfile package :** 
$ pacman -S pkgfile

**Once installed the pkgfile database can be synced with :**
$ pkgfile -u

**Enable its system timer servce :**
$ systemctl enable pkgfile-update.timer

**Then add to the .bashrc file :**  
	source /usr/share/doc/pkgfile/command-not-found.bash


== Auto cd when entering just a path : ==
Allows you to write /etc		instead of cd /etc
	shopt -s autocd

	shopt -s checkwinsize
	

== Complete sudo commands : ==
	complete -cf sudo



===== .inputrc =====
Resides in ~/.inputrc	Below can be added to the .inputrc file for preffered configurations. 
Make sure 	$include /etc/inputrc 	is present in the top of the .inputrc file. 

== Search with arrow-keys : ==
You can start to type a command, then use arrow keys to search through your history for that combination :
	"\e[A": history-search-backward
	"\e[B": history-search-forward


== Faster completion : ==
Single tab will show all available commands 		instead of double tab.
	set show-all-if-ambiguous on
	

== Disable ^C echo on ctrl-c : ==
	set echo-control-characters off
