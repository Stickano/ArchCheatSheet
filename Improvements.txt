====== Improvements ======
Created s√∏ndag 23 oktober 2016

===== .bashrc =====
Resides in ~/.bashrc	Below can be added to the .bashrc file for preferred configuration. 

== Disable logging of identical commands : ==
	export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups


== Search official repositories when a command was invalid : ==
**This requires the pkgfile package :** 
$ pacman -S pkgfile

**Once installed the pkgfile database can be synced with :**
$ pkgfile -u

**Enable its system timer servce :**
$ systemctl enable pkgfile-update.timer

**Then add to the .bashrc file :**  
	source /usr/share/doc/pkgfile/command-not-found.bash


== Auto cd when entering just a path : ==
Allows you to write /etc		instead of cd /etc
	shopt -s autocd


== Line wrap on window resize : ==
	shopt -s checkwinsize	

== Complete sudo commands : ==
	complete -cf sudo
	
== Correct minor writing errors : ==
	shopt -s cdspell
	
== Include . (dot) files in pathname ==
	shopt -s dotglob
	
== Execute aliases instant, when combined with a different command ==
**# If you run a **//command + alias//** in the same line, by default, the alias command will be read as a new line.**
**# Therefore, it would execute the command, wait, then execute the alias. **
**# This will correct that behaviour and run the alias in the first execute.**
	shopt -s expand_aliases
	
== Extended pattern matching in pathnames ==
		shopt -s extglob
		


===== .inputrc =====
Resides in ~/.inputrc	Below can be added to the .inputrc file for preffered configurations. 
Make sure 	$include /etc/inputrc 	is present in the top of the .inputrc file. 

== Search with arrow-keys : ==
You can start to type a command, then use arrow keys to search through your history for that combination :
	"\e[A": history-search-backward
	"\e[B": history-search-forward


== Faster completion : ==
Single tab will show all available commands 		instead of double tab.
	set show-all-if-ambiguous on
	

== Disable ^C echo on ctrl-c : ==
	set echo-control-characters off
