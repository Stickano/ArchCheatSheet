====== Keys ======
Created tirsdag 22 november 2016

**SSH Keys are used instead of passwords - an fast authentication. **

== A quick info ==
**SSH keys are generated in pairs - one public and one private. Share the public key all you want, but safeguard the private key. **

**The public key is then used to encrypt a message - the public key is NOT able to decrypt this very same message - so the trick is, that the public key gives you an **encrypted** message which only the private key-holder will be able to give the appropriate responds to. **

== Storage ==
**#** **The keys is by default stored in  **//~/.ssh///
**#** **The public key will be the one with the **//.pub //**suffix**

== Generate a pair of SSH keys ==
**# We append **//-C//** to add a comment. In this case the user, host and date is used for easy verification**
$ ssh-keygen -C "$(whoami)@$(hostname)-$(date -I)"

**# You will be prompted where to store the private key - leave this option to default (**//~/.ssh///**)**
**# Choose a strong Password**

== Change Password on a private key - without changing the key itself ==
$ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh///key-id// -p

== Copy public key to remote server ==
**# If the SSH server does not run on port 22, append the 	**//-p <PORT_NUMBER>//
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh///key_id//.pub username@remote-server.org
