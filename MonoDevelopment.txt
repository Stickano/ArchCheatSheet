====== MonoDevelopment ======
Created Monday 27 February 2017

**I cry a little every time I fire up Windows, so being able to do some small basic C# in Linux will be nice.**

== Installation ==
**# We'll need a couple of packages for the framework and the IDE**
$ pacman -S mono mono-basic monodevelop mono-tools

**# Mono calls Xterm when you run projects - install it for your Console Applications**
$ pacman -S xterm


== Running applications ==
**# Again, limited to the Console Applications I'm quite sure**
$ mono ///path/to/exe/file//
