====== PSD and ASD ======
Created l√∏rdag 03 december 2016

**PSD will sync browser profiles to memory - thus speeding up browser responsiveness and reduces wear down on the drive. PSD does not take in account, that the major browsers caches are separate from their profile foler. Therefore we use ASD to sync that folder.**

===== Installation =====
**# Install both PSD and ASD from the AUR**
$ yaourt -S profile-sync-daemon anything-sync-daemon

===== Profile Sync Daemon =====
**# RUN psd once to create a initial config file**
$ psd

**#** **PSD has its configuration file in **//~/.config/psd/psd.conf//
**# In this configuration file, define your browser - you can add more browser (space seperated list)**
**# Uncomment and set to **//yes//** in the **//USE_OVERLAYFS//** variable - NOTE: the overlayfs point below.**

== OVERLAYFS ==
**# Overlayfs will reduce the memory footprint by only syncing what has changed.**
**#** **Where the default is to sync the whole profile. **
 
**# In order for this to work though, you need some sudo rights. Edit your **//sudoer//** file**
$ sudo visudo 

**# And add this line **
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
foo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/psd-overlay-helper
}}}


== Enable the service ==
$ systemctl --user enable psd.service

== Usage ==
**# You can get a informative parse with**
$ psd p

**# To remove the recovery snapshots**
$ psd c


===== Anything Sync Daemon =====
**# The configuration file is stored in **///etc/asd.conf //
**#** **Add you browsers cache folder to the **//WHATTOSYNC //**variable.**
**# You browsers cache can be found in **//~/.cache/<browserChoice>/<profileName> //**or something like that.**
**# Ex. **
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
WHATTOSYNC=('/home/stick/.cache/mozilla/firefox/tta26zga.default')
}}}


**# Outcomment and add **///dev/shm//** (recommended on arch-wiki) to the **//VOLATILE //**variable**
**# This is recommended since software like BleachBit clears files in **///tmp//** - so **///dev/shm//** is preferred**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
VOLATILE="/dev/shm"
}}}


**# Uncomment and set to **//yes//** in the **//USE_OVERLAYFS//** variable and modprobe **//overlay//
$ modprobe overlay

== Enable the service ==
$ systemctl enable asd.service

== Usage ==
**# Works like PSD. To get information**
$ asd p

**# To clean the recovery snapshots**
$ asd c
