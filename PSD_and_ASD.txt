====== PSD and ASD ======
Created l√∏rdag 03 december 2016

**# PSD will sync browser profiles to memory - thus speeding up browser responsiveness and weardown on the drive.**
**# PSD does not take in account, that the major browsers caches are seperate from their profile foler. **
**# Therefore we use ASD to sync that folder.**

===== Installation =====
**# Install both PSD and ASD from the AUR**
$ yaourt -S profile-sync-daemon anything-sync-daemon

===== Profile Sync Daemon =====
**# RUN psd once to create a initial config file**
$ psd

**#** **PSD has its configuration file in **//~/.config/psd/psd.conf//
**# In this configuration file, define your browser - you can add more browser (space seperated list)**
**# Uncomment and set to **//yes//** in the **//USE_OVERLAYFS//** variable - NOTE: the overlayfs point below.**

== OVERLAYFS ==
**# Overlayfs will reduce the memory footprint by only syncing what has changed, and not the whole profile.**
**# In order for this to work though, you need some sudo rights. Edit your **//sudoer//** file**
$ sudo visudo 

**# And add this line **
	foo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/psd-overlay-helper


== Enable the service ==
$ systemctl --user enable psd.service

== Usage ==
**# You can get a informative parse with**
$ psd p

**# To remove the recovery snapshots**
$ psd c


===== Anything Sync Daemon =====
**# The config file is stored in **///etc/asd.conf //**add you browsers cache folder to the **//WHATTOSYNC //**variable.**
**# You browsers cache can be found in **//~/.cache/<browserChoice>/<profileName>	//**or something like that.**
**# Ex. **//WHATTOSYNC=('/home/stick/.cache/mozilla/firefox/tta26zga.default')//

**# Uncomment and add **///dev/shm//** (recommended on arch-wiki) to the **//VOLATILE //**variable**
**# This is recommended since software like BleachBit clears files in **///tmp//** - so **///dev/shm//** is preferred**
	VOLATILE="/dev/shm"

**# Uncomment and set to **//yes//** in the **//USE_OVERLAYFS//** variable and modprobe **//overlay//
$ modprobe overlay

== Enable the service ==
$ systemctl enable asd.service

== Usage ==
**# Works like PSD. To get information**
$ asd p

**# To clean the recovery snapshots**
$ asd c
