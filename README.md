## Good-to-knowhttp://zim-wiki.org/
A lot of this information comes from the [Arch Wikipedia](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) - I just got tired of going through page after page of (though valueable) information. 

Having had my learning process/battles with Arch Linux (I'm no power user at all) I found it profitable to have a place where I could quickly reference something for configuration and basic usage. Arch Wiki provides you with so much good information, but it is very time-consuming to go through it all - even just the items I need for my personal setup. 

**I do _not_ recommend you to use this Cheat Sheet though**. It has some good information here and there, but you will get a far better understanding of the different items in this Cheat Sheet, by going through them at the Arch Wiki. Besides, this is works well for me - on my machine - no guarantee it will work for you/ on your machine.
