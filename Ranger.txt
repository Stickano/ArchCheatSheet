====== Ranger ======
Created Thursday 12 January 2017

**Ranger is a Vi like file manager - simply put, file manager from the terminal.**

== Installation ==
**# The File Manager**
$ pacman -S ranger

**# My config also uses **//atool//** for file extraction/compression**
$ pacman -S atool

**# The sweet image previewer also needs **//w3w//
$ pacman -S w3m 

**# Folder/file Search (custom command) also needs **//zfz//
$ pacman -S zfz

===== Configuration =====
**# Configuration files at Github**
**# **//Ranger//** reads its configuration files from **//~/.config/ranger//

**# Three files worth looking at; **
	**# **//rc.conf //**= startup commands and keybinds**
	**# **//commands.py //**= commands which are launched with : (colon)**
	**# **//rifle.conf //**= applications to use, when a file is launched **


== Default Configurations ==
**# To get a copy of the default configuration files, run**
$ ranger --copy-config=all

===== Themes =====
**# You can find some sweet themes here **http://dotshare.it/category/fms/ranger/
**# To use a different theme than the default, first create a new subfolder **
$ mkdir ~/.config/ranger/colorschemes

**# Then add the colorscheme to a **//.py//** file (**//colorscheme.py //**ex)**

**# Look at the ClassName for the scheme you find**
**# And the name to the **//colorscheme//** variable in **//~/.config/ranger/rc.conf// 
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
set colorscheme ColorScheme
}}}



===== Troubleshoot =====
**# If you're experiencing problems with Ranger, it's probably caused by your personal configurations **
**# Run a clean instance (without the local **//~/.config/ranger/* //**configurations)**
$ ranger --clean

**# If this solves the issue - you can ex. do the **//Copy Default Configurations//** from above - or sort your own out**
