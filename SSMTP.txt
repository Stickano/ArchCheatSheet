====== SSMTP ======
Created Friday 13 January 2017

**SSMTP is a program that can deliver E-mails from our local computer. **

== Installation ==
$ pacman -S ssmtp

== Configuration ==
**# This is setup to deliver mails to my private domain mail (info@sloa.dk)**
**# For obvious reasons, the password has been left out **
**# Corrected this, then override the default **///etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf//** with the following **
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
# The user that gets all the mails (UID < 1000, usually the admin)
root=info@sloa.dk

# The mail server (where the mail is sent to), both port 465 or 587 should be acceptable
# See also https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78799
mailhub=asmtp.unoeuro.com:587

# The address where the mail appears to come from for user authentication.
rewriteDomain=unoeuro.com

# The full hostname
hostname=dinnabo

# Use SSL/TLS before starting negotiation
UseTLS=Yes
UseSTARTTLS=Yes

# Username/Password
AuthUser=info@sloa.dk
AuthPass=
AuthMethod=LOGIN

# Email 'From header's can override the default domain?
FromLineOverride=yes
}}}


**# Having passwords in plaintext is insecure - so we'll secure the newly edited **//ssmtp.conf//** file**
**# Create a ssmtp group**
$ groupadd ssmtp

**# Set the newly created group as owner of the **//ssmtp.conf//** file**
$ chown :ssmtp /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

**# Set the newly created group as owner of the ssmtp binary**
$ chown :ssmtp /usr/bin/ssmtp

**# Limit access to just root and ssmtp**
$ chmod 640 /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

**# And set the SGID on the ssmtp binary**
$ chmod g+s /usr/bin/ssmtp

== Usage ==
**# Test if everything works**
$ echo "this is the body" | mail -s "Subject" jeppesen@tutanota.com

**# You can also send mails by creating a empty text file and providing it to the mail function.**
**# Here's a template; **//~/test-mail.txt//
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
To:jeppesen@tutanota.com
From:info@sloa.dk
Subject: Test

This is a test mail.
}}}


**# Then provide the text-file to the mail function**
$ mail jeppesen@tutanota.com < ~/test-mail.txt
