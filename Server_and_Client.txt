====== Server and Client ======
Created l√∏rdag 03 december 2016

**# Install the **//openssh//** package. This will have to be installed on both a client or a server machine.**
$ pacman -S openssh

===== Client Usage =====
**# Client side usage**
**# The default SSH port is **//22//

== Usage ==
**# Connecting to a server**
$ ssh -p //<portnumber> <user>//@//<server-address>	//**# Note the **//@ //**between user and address.**

== Tips and Tricks ==
**# Run process on the server display output - ex. running **//mplayer//** on your media-server^**
$ DISPLAY=:0 mplayer ///path/to/movie //-fs

== Configuration ==
**# Add/edit **//~/.ssh/config  //**This will be referred to as the ssh configuration**
**# Add a global username for all the hosts you visit**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
User <USER_NAME>
}}}

	
**# Improved performance, add the following to the ssh configuration**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
ControlMaster auto
ControlPersist yes
ControlPath ~/.ssh/sockets/socket-%r@%h:%p
}}}


== Host Aliasses ==
**# To provide an alias for a commonly used host, add the following to the ssh config**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
Host <SERVER_NAME> # Give it a optional name
	HostName <SERVER_ADDRESS>
	Port     <PORT_NUMBER>
}}}


**# You are now able to use alias shortcuts, instead of the full **//ssh user@host//** string**
$ ssh //<SERVER_NAME>//


===== Server Usage =====
**# Server side usage**

== URxvt ==
**# While using URxvt on your local (client) machine, it'll act up connecting to the server.**
**# Binds all messed and what not - To fix this, install **//rxvt-unicode-terminfo //**on the server machine**
$ pacman -S rxvt-unicode-terminfo

== Configuration ==
**# The configuration file can be found in **///etc/ssh/sshd_config	//
**#** **Note the "d" **//ssh//**d**_config **(daemon)	- This will be referred to as the configuration file **

**# Disable root login, edit the following in the configuration file**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
PermitRootLogin no
}}}


**# Change port number (optional) - default is port 22**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
Port <PORT_NUMBER>
}}}

	
**# To disable the SSH login (password login) - f.ex. to only use SSH key authentication (See below). **
**# Uncomment and change to **//no//** in the following **
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
}}}


== SSH key authentication ==
**# The public key, from the client, will have to be located on the server machine.**
**# Say our clients public SSH key is located on our servers home folder **//~///<somekey>//.pub//

**# Create, if it doesn't already exists, a folder at **//~/.ssh//
$ mkdir ~/.ssh
$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh

**# Import the public key, from the client, to the **//authorized_keys//** file **
$ cat ~///<somekey>//.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

**# Remove the public key and change the folder permission back to only user-usable**
$ rm ~///<somekey>//.pub
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


==== Starting the daemon ====
**# Starting the server side daemon**

== The easy way ==
**#** **just starting the daemon to constantly be running (preferred option below)**
**# This method might come in handy if you have several (maybe unknown) IPs connecting**
$ systemctl enable sshd.service		**# Note the preferred option below!**

== The preferred way ==
**# To only start the daemon process when a allowed connection is incomming, enable the following**
$ systemctl enable sshd.socket
$ systemctl enable sshd@.service

**# Edit your socket file to ONLY allow certain IP-adresses**
$ systemctl edit sshd.socket

**# Add the following - portnumber is the port that the SERVER/HOST is listening for (default 22)**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
	[socket]
	FreeBind=true
	ListenStream=		# Add ip and portnumber, ex 192.168.0.1:22
	ListenStream=<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT_NUMBER>
}}}



==== Tips and Tricks ====
**# Some random Tips and Tricks**

== Keep Alive ==
**# To make sure that the SSH server wont log you out, **
**#** **uncomment and change the following in the configuration file**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
ClientAliveInterval 120
}}}
