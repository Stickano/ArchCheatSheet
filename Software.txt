**We'll list a few methods of getting Application, Driver, kernel and log information**

== Logs ==
**#** Y**ou can use **//|grep //** for a more specific result**
**#** **You'll usually find error logs in **///var/logs//

== dmesg ==
**# dmesg is an event viewer**
$ dmesg

== Kernel ==
# **To show kernel drivers handling each device **
$ lspci -k

**# Show Kernel**
$ uname -a

== GPU driver ==
**# Show which video-driver is being used by X-org**
$ lspci -nnk | grep -i vga -A3 | grep 'in use'

== Application ==
**# Show possible locations for application**
$ whereis //<APP_NAME>//

**# Show what will be run be default **
$ which //<APP_NAME>//

== tldr ==
**# **//man//** pages are genius**
**# **//tldr //**is the to long don't read of **//man//** pages **
**# It will cut straight to the chase and tell you the most common commands^**
$ yaourt -S nodejs-tldr-git

**# Then just use it the same way, you would with **//man//
**# Ex for **//tar//
$ tldr tar
