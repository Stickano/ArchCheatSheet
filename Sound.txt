====== Sound ======
Created onsdag 28 december 2016

**Getting Alsa to play over bluetooth proved tricky - and the management/control was terrible. **
**The sound works out-the-box with **//PulseAudio//** and it made bluetooth output a lot easier.**


== Alsa default device ==
**# By default alsa doesn't detect the correct device for me. **
**# To correct this, create/edit **///etc/modprobe.d/modprobe.conf//
**# And add the following line. A reboot is required before it'll take effect.**
	options snd_hda_intel index=1


===== PulseAudio =====
**# **//PulseAudio//** is the sound server that will manage our sound through Alsa. **

== Installation ==
$ pacman -S pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa lib32-libpulse lib32-alsa-plugins

== Configuration ==
**# **//PulseAudio//** comes with a set of modules that can be loaded.**
**# These modules will be loaded from **//~/.config/pulse/default.pa//
**# To load a module, create/edit that file, and add**
	load-module //<module_name>//
	
**# Modules available is fount here; **
**# **https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Modules/

== Pavucontrol ==
**# To get GUI controls, install **//pavucontrol //
$ pacman -S pavucontrol


===== Bluetooth Speaker =====
**# This requires you've to have been through **bluetooth**.**

== Installation ==
$ pacman -S pulseaudio-bluetooth bluez-libs bluez-firmware

== Usage ==
**# Connect to the device as explained in **bluetooth**.**
**# You should now be able to select the output through **//pavucontrol//**.**

== Tips and Tricks ==
**# To autoconnect when starting the **//bluetooth.service//
**# First add this to the **//~/.config/pulse/default.pa//
	**# automatically switch to newly-connected devices**
	load-module module-switch-on-connect

**# Then **//trust//** the device through the **//bluetoothctl//** shell**
**# Obtain and pair the device MAC as explained in **[[../Bluetooth.txt|bluetooth]] 
$ bluetoothctl
$ trust //<MAC_ADDRESS>//

**# The bluetooth adapter does not **//power on //**between reboots**
**# (the **//bluetoothctl//** > **//power on//** powering on)**
**# To correct this, create a udev rule in **///etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules//
**# Add the following**
	**# Set bluetooth power up**
	ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="bluetooth", KERNEL=="hci[0-9]*", RUN+="/usr/bin/hciconfig %k up"
