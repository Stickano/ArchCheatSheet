====== Steam ======
Created Tuesday 17 January 2017

== Installation ==
**# These packages are required by Steam (some might already be installed)**
**# You should also have been through **//Video Driver//** and **//Sound//** for 32-bit support of both sound and video**
$ pacman -S steam lib32-curl lib32-libgpg-error steam-native-runtime

== Running ==
**# Always use the **//steam-native//** command - or the **//Steam (Native)//** from dmenu.**

===== Configuration =====
**# Steam allows you to use custom commands when launching games**
**# From your Steam Library, right click any game and select Properties - From here, Set the Launch Options**
**# Steam replaces **//%command%//** with the game-launch command**
**# Below is a couple of Launch Options examples (**//Game Library > Right Click Game > Options > Set Launch Options//**)**

== 64-bit Games ==
**# To use the Nvidia driver (optirun) on a 64b game, set this launch option**
	LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/nvidia/libGL.so optirun %command%


== 32-bit Games ==
**# Like-wise for 32b games, set this launch option**
	LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/nvidia/libGL.so optirun %command%
	

== Desktop Entries ==
**# Instead of having to decide between native and runtime when you wanna run steam**
**# Copy the **//steam.desktop//** to your local application folder**
$ cp /usr/share/applications/steam.desktop ~/.local/share/applications

**# Then Edit the copied entry and add the following line**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
NoDisplay=true
}}}


**# For the Steam Native entry, first create a file in **///usr/local/bin/steam-preload//** and add the following**
**# This will also force Steam to load the up-to-date system libraries **
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
LD_PRELOAD='/usr/$LIB/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/$LIB/libgcc_s.so.1 /usr/$LIB/libxcb.so.1 /usr/$LIB/libgpg-error.so' /usr/bin/steam "$@"
}}}


**# The Copy the Steam Native entry**
$ cp /usr/share/applications/steam-native.desktop ~/.local/share/applications

**# And Edit the **//Exec//** line to run our newly created file**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
Exec=/usr/local/bin/steam-preload %U
}}}


== Close Button ==
**# Steam will not react at all when you hit the x (close) button. **
**# Note, this fix will make sure Steam closes to status-bar, but it is still running!**
**#** **Edit **///usr/bin/steam//** and add the following environment variable **
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
export STEAM_FRAME_FORCE_CLOSE=1
}}}
