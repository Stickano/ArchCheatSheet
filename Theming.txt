====== Theming ======
Created mandag 19 december 2016

**I'll try to put-together a list of sweet ass themes. **
**Manage your themes with **lxappearance**.**

**Lxappearance will allow you to set a system wide font in gtk themed application etc.**
**One of the reason we use lxappearance, is to generate a couple of GTK files - Both for gtk-2 and gtk-3, which reads its configurations from different locations.**

== Installation ==
$ pacman -S lxappearance

== Running ==
**# You can run **//lxappearance //**to get the GUI controls. **

== Configuration ==
**# Changing a font value in lxappearance (and apply) will generate a couple of configs for gtk-2 and gtk-3.**
**# Find them in **//~/.gtkrc-2.0 //**and **//~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini //**and change the content to your liking.**



===== Window Themes =====

== Arc ==
**# The **//arc-theme//** is pretty sweet**
**# As long as you use Firefox, you should install the following **//arc-theme//
$ yaourt -S arc-firefox-theme
