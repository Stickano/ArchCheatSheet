====== Touchpad ======
Created tirsdag 27 december 2016

**To get a proper working touch - specially lousy on the Asus Zenbook models - a little setting up is required. The default mouse behavior is terrible, so you will want to set this at a early state.**

== Installation ==
**# The Wayland driver is a better solution. Install it with a Xorg-wrapper.**
$ pacman -S xf86-input-libinput

== Configuration ==
**# Create a file in **///etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf//** and add the following**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad"
        Driver "libinput"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Option "PalmDetect" "1"
        Option "PalmMinWidth" "8"
        Option "PalmMinZ" "100"
        Option "Tapping" "on"
EndSection
