====== Touchpad ======
Created tirsdag 27 december 2016

**To get a proper working touch - specially lousy on the Asus Zenbook models - a little setting up is required. The default mouse behavior is terrible, so you will want to set this at a early state.**

== Installation ==
**# The Wayland driver is a better solution. Install it with a Xorg-wrapper.**
$ pacman -S xf86-input-libinput

**# This will by default have auto-disable when typing, palm detection and more.**

== Gestures ==
**# You'll have to disable some driver features, for gestures to work.**
**# The configuration needed is found at the bottom of this page.**

**# Install **//touchegg//** from the AUR**
$ yaourt -S touchegg

**# Start it with your **xinitrc**.**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"

}}}

	
**# Configuration can be found in **//~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf//
**# Even better, get the GUI tool**
$ yaourt -S touchegg-gce-git


===== Xorg Touchpad Configuration =====
**# The following is placed in **///etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf//
**# This will disable some **libinput** driver features - **
**# Which will** **allow gestures (**//touchegg//**) to work.**
