====== Users and Groups ======
Created l√∏rdag 22 oktober 2016

**List files owned by a user or group :**
$ find / -group //group//
$ find / -user //user//


==== User management ====
**To see all users : **sudo passwd -Sa

**To add a new user : **
Adding users can be done with //useradd//		set password after creating the user.
	-G = add user to additional groups
	-m = create a /home folder for the user
	-s = path to default login shell
	
$ useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash stickano
$ passwd stickano

**Change login name : **usermod -l //newname oldname//

**Change home directory : **usermod -d ///my/new/home// -m //username//
-m creates the required folders and move the content there

**Add user to a group : **usermod -aG //additional_groups username//
**Or :				    **gpasswd --add //username group//

**Remove user from a group : **gpasswd -d //user group//
If the user is logged in, changes will take affect after logout

**Expire password requiring them to create a new on first login : **chage -d 0 //username//

**Delete user : **userdel -r //username//
-r removes the home directory for the user


==== Group management ====
**List groups that a user is member of : **groups //username//

**List all groups on the system : **cat /etc/group

**Create a new group : **groupadd //newgroup//

**Delete group : **groupdel //group//

**User groups : **
Below is a list of general user groups - users can, and sometimes have to, be added to these groups without worries. 

adm	                # admin group, similar to //wheel//
ftp                    # access to file-server by ftp-servers
games               # access to some game software
http                  # access to files served by the HTTP server
log                   # access to logs in /var/log/ 	
rfkill                 # access to control wireless power (TX-power)
sys                   # access to administor printers
users                # standard user group
uucp                 # access to the RS-232 ports and their connected devices (old keyboard, printer, mouses etc)
wheel               # administration group commonly used to give access to sudo/su	none is set by default


==== Tips and Tricks ====
**Add user to the sudoers file, to disable asking for password for a user when using **//sudo// **command :**
The sudoers configuration file is located at /etc/sudoers. This file should always be edited with the //visudo// editor. 
$ EDITOR=nano visudo

**Add the following to the bottom of the file** 
Defaults:////username////      !authenticate
