====== VA-API and VDPAU ======
Created Thursday 23 February 2017

**VA-API and VDPAU makes is possible for video cards to decode/encode video and thus offloade some workforce from the CPU. It says that it will therefore save power (by offloading to CPU) but I do seriously doubt that, since it'll just bring an even more power-demanding device into play.**

**VA-API is for the Intel Driver and VDPAU is for the Nvidia driver.**

== Installation ==
**# This uses VDPAU as backend for VA-API**
$ pacman -S libva-vdpau-driver

**# These two packages will make VA-API work as backend for VDPAU**
$ pacman -S libvdpau-va-gl libva-intel-driver

== Verifying ==
**# To verify VA-API, install **//libva//
$ pacman -S libva

**# and run **
$ vainfo

**# You should get something like below, a driver has been found is it should handle the rest itself**
	vainfo: Driver version: Intel i965 driver ....
	
**# To verify VDPAU, install **//vdpauinfo//
$ pacman -S vdpauinfo

**# and run**
$ vdpauinfo

**# You should have something like this in the output**
	Information string: OpenGL/VAAPI backend for VDPAU
