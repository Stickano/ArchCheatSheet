Created Saturday 29 April 2017


== Installation ==
**# Core packages (the **//linux-[lts/zen]-headers//** should already be installed)**
$ pacman -S virtualbox virtualbox-host-dkms net-tools virtualbox-guest-iso

**# Extension Package from the AUR**
**# Provides USB, webcam etc functionality in VM**
$ cower -d virtualbox-ext-oracle
$ cowup

$ gpasswd --add stick vboxusers 


===== Using =====
**# How to install and configure your Virtual Machines**

== Installing Image ==
**# Download the image you wish to make a VM off**
**# Open VirtualBox and click **//New//

**# Choose a **//Type//** and **//Version//** along with a relevant name.**
**# Allocate some memory - don't overdo it. Somewhere between 2-4GB, on my 8GB machine.**
**# Select **//Create a Virtual Hard Disk Drive//
**# Choose **//VHD//** for Windows products and **//VDI//** for everything else. **
**# Dynamically allocated space works fine**
**# Give it an initial size**

**# The "machine" is now set-up and you are able to install a image file on it**
**# Right click the VM and select **//Settings//
**# Go to **//Storage//** and select the Empty device in the sub-node**
**# Click the little Disc next to the Drop-down (SATA Port1) and select your image file to install**
**# Start the VM to start the installer. Voila. **

== Import OVA/OVF files ==
**# Go to **//File > Import Appliance //
**# This will setup your pre-defined VM installation **

== Additional Settings ==
**# Once a system has been installed, you can increase the performance for that VM**
**# Right click the VM and select **//Settings//

**# You can Enable Shared Clipboard in **//General > Advanced//
**# You can set Base-Memory in **//System //**- don't overdo, somewhere between 2-4GB on my 8GB machine**
**# In **//System > Processor //**you can add an additional core**
**# Enable **//3D //**and **//2D Acceleration //**in **//Display//** and crank that **//Video Memory //**to max (256MB)**
**# In **//Storage//**, select the VM name (sub-node) and check **//Solid State Drive//

== Guest Addition ==
**# The guest addition allows for hardware acceleration, shared clipboard a.a.**
**# The package has been installed with the Core files (above)**
**# Once your system is installed, mount the Guest ISO at the USB device and install the additions from**
**# inside the system itself. **

**# The Guest ISO can be found at **///usr/lib/virtualbox/additions/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso//
**# Mount this in VirtualBox, either by Right-clicking a VM and select **//Settings > Storage //**and mounting it**
**# Or by mounting it through **//Devices//** at the top of a running VM.**

**# In Windows f.ex. you just open the File-Manager and double click the USB device (VirtualBox Guest)**
**# and let the auto-installer do the rest. **

== Fullscreen View (troubleshoot) ==
**# The Fullscreen doesn't work with I3**
**# Right click your VM and select **//Settings > User Interface//** and deselect the **//Show in Full-screen/Seamless//
**# Toggle Fullscreen with **//Right Ctrl+F//
