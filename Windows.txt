Created Saturday 18 March 2017

**When dual-booting Windows/Arch, the time is not running correct in Arch.. Thank you Microsoft.**
**We can fix this be setting the time to UTC in Windows though, so fire up that sucker OS. **

== Regedit ==
**# We need to Add a entry in the Regedit, so do the **//Super+r//** to open the Run dialog and type; **//regedit//
**# Navigate into the following sub-folder**
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation

**# Right click and Add a **//DWORD//** with **//hexadecimal//** called **//RealTimeIsUniversal//**, set the value to **//1//
