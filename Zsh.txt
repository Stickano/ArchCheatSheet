====== Zsh ======
Created l√∏rdag 17 december 2016

**Zsh is an alternate, improved, version from the Bash shell (default).**
**My **//.zshrc//** file can be found at Github**

== Installation ==
$ pacman -S zsh

**# Then make it the default Shell - don't run with sudo!**
$ chsh -s /bin/zsh

**# For the **//Fish//**-like syntax highligthing**
$ pacman -S zsh-syntax-highlighting

== Configuring $PATH ==
**# Paths should be set in a different configuration, since there is some source conflict with /etc/profile**
**# To prevent the path from being overwritten, set it in **//~/.zprofile//
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
typeset -U path
path=(~/bin /home/stick/.scripts /usr/local/bin $path[@])
}}}



===== Configuration =====
**# User configuration is found in **//~/.zshrc//
**# My Zsh configuration file can be found at Github. **

== Search official repositories when a command was invalid ==
**#** **This requires the pkgfile package **
$ pacman -S pkgfile

**#** **Once installed the pkgfile database can be synced with **
$ pkgfile -u

**#** **Enable its system timer servce **
$ systemctl enable pkgfile-update.timer

**# Then add the following to the **//~/.zshrc//** file **
**#** **This is already incl. in my configuration. Just make sure the package is installed.**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
source /usr/share/doc/pkgfile/command-not-found.zsh
}}}


== Defining Keybinds ==
**# To get a key-value, first hit **//Ctrl+v//** and then push the key (or key combo) to get its value**
**# That value can be used in a **//bindkey//** variable to define its action, ex;**
**# (Control+Delete to delete forward word) **//Ctrl+v  Ctrl+Delete //** outputs **//^[[3^//
**# Then we define the action of that value in the our **//.zshrc //
**#** **( **//kill-word//** is the command to forward delete word)**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
bindkey '^[[3^' kill-word
}}}

**# OMZsh is a shitload of additional functions and themes ready to use out-the-box**
**# Below is still just added to the **//.zshrc//** file - OMZsh just adds a little extra.**
