== Configuring $PATH ==
**# Paths should be set in a different configuration, since there is some source conflict with /etc/profile**
**# To prevent the path from being overwritten, set it in **//~/.zprofile//
	typeset -U path
	path=(~/bin /home/stick/.scripts /usr/local/bin $path[@])
	

===== Configuration =====
**# User configuration is found in **//~/.zshrc//
