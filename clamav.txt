====== clamav ======
Created s√∏ndag 04 december 2016

== Installation ==
$ pacman -S clamav

== Update ==
**# Update the virus definitions after installation**
**# NOTE! This must be done the first time, BEFORE enabling the service.**
$ freshclam

**# Enable clam update service, so clamav will always have the latest virus definitions**
$ systemctl enable freshclamd.service

== Additional virus definition/databases ==
**# Install some un-official virus definitions as well**
$ yaourt -S clamav-unofficial-sigs

== Test clamav ==
**# Make sure your clamav and its definitions are installed correct (harmless file)**
$ curl http://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt | clamscan -

**# The output must include **
	stdin: Eicar-Test-Signature FOUND
	

== Usage ==
**# Scan a file**
$ clamscan //<FILE_NAME>//

**# Scan a directory**
$ clamscan -r -i ///path/to/folder//

**# Scan entire system**
$ clamscan -r -i --exclude-dir='^/sys|^/dev' /


===== Troubleshoot =====
**# Lord know there's been a few..**

== Clamd was not notified on freshclam ==
**# When I tried to run **//freshclam//** it failed. The following should be the solution.**
**# Add a sock file for clamd **
$ touch /var/lib/clamav/clamd.sock
$ chown clamav:clamav /var/lib/clamav/clamd.sock

**# Then Edit  **///etc/clamav/clamd.conf //**and uncomment the following line**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
LocalSocket /var/lib/clamav/clamd.sock
}}}
