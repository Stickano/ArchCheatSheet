**# Local configurations for many of these applications can be found at Github **

== FROM THE OFFICIAL REPOSITORY ==
**# Install the **//i3//** package group**
$ pacman -S i3

**# **//dmenu//** will launch applications on the fly. Here is a nice drop-in for **//dmenu//
$ pacman -S rofi

**# My logout script requires **//polkit //**too (Github)**
$ pacman -S polkit

**# For the **//$mod+l//** lock screen you need **//imagemagick//** and **//scrot// **(Github)**
**# You also need a icon (**https://www.iconfinder.com**) and correct it in the **//i3 //**config.**
$ pacman -S imagemagick scrot

$ pacman -S lm_sensors

**# (Statusbar) Battery indicator needs **//ACPI//
$ pacman -S acpi

**# (Statusbar) CPU monitor needs **//sysstat//
$ pacman -S sysstat

== FROM THE AUR ==
**# You need the **//i3blocks//** for your i3status bar**
$ yaourt -S i3blocks

**# The screen locker needs **//xss-lock//** (auto lock/ 10min.)**
**# You can change the background image for the lockscreen in the **//i3//** config**
$ yaourt -S xss-lock-git

**# You need **//font-awesome//** to display icons in the workspace bar **
$ yaourt -S ttf-font-awesome

== NOTE ==
**#** **Also install the ttf-font-package that you chose and correct in **//i3//** config.**


===== Configuration =====
**# A complete user guide for **//i3//** can be fount at **https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.htm
**# Launch **//i3//** on login with **xinitrc**. Add the following to your **//~/.xinitrc//** file.**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
exec i3 
}}}


**# First time **//i3//** is run it'll provide you with a configuration wizard. **
**# Quit the wizard and copy your config to **//~/.config/i3/config//

== i3status ==
**# Local **//i3status//** configuration at Github.**
**# This file is read from **//~/.config/i3status/config //**(can be defined in **//i3//** configuration)**
**# A default version of this file can be fount at **///etc/i3status.conf//

== Getting Window Information ==
**# Should you change your applications and want information for key-binding etc**
**# Install the **//xorg-xprop//** package**
$ pacman -S xorg-xprop

**# Run **//xprop//** and watch your cursor turn into a corsair. Now click the Window you want information about.**
**# The **//WM_CLASS(STRING) = "Navigator", "Firefox" //**(etc) is probably what you are looking for.**

== Icons in Workspace bar ==
**# You should have the **//font-awesome//** package installed.**
**# A nice cheat-sheet for these icons can be found here **http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/
**# Then just copy the icon you'd like into the string in the configuration file.**

== Saving Window Layout # THIS NEED RE-WRITING / NOT REALLY FUNCTIONAL ==
**# Needs **//perl-anyevent-i3//** and **//perl-json-xs//
$ pacman -S perl-anyevent-i3 perl-json-xs

**# Create a layout your workspaces. Remember what programs/commands is run.**
**# Then save that layout to a json file.**
**#** //N//** = workspace.**
$ i3-save-tree --workspace //N// > ~/.config/i3/layouts/workspace_//N//.json

**# Once the workspace files has been created, they need to be edited**
**# **//N//** still equals workspace^**
$ tail -n +2 ~/.config/i3/layouts/workspace_N.json | fgrep -v '// splitv' | sed 's|//||g' > ~/.config/i3/layouts/workspace_N.json

**# Then create execute-able Shell files to use the json snippets.**
**# Let's say you have 2 workspaces set up. **
# **Create 2 files in **//~/.config/i3/layouts//
**# **//load_layout_1.sh //**AND	**// load_layout_2.sh load//
**# These files needs to look like the following.**
**# Note that the applications that needs to run on a desktop, needs to specified**
**# **//N//** is funny enough still the number of the workspace^**

	#!/bin/bash
	# First we append the saved layout of worspace N to workspace M
	i3-msg "workspace M; append_layout ~/.config/i3/layouts/workspace_N.json"
	
	# And finally we fill the containers with the programs they had
	(uxterm &)
	(firefox &)
	(nautilus &)

**# Make the Shell files executeable**
$ chmod u+x ~/.config/i3/layouts/load_layout_//N//.sh

**# You can now run the Shell scripts - or add them to your **//i3//** config**
