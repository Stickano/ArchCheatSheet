}}}

**# Quit the wizard and copy your config to **//~/.config/i3/config//

== i3status ==
**# Local **//i3status//** configuration at Github.**
**# This file is read from **//~/.config/i3status/config //**(can be defined in **//i3//** configuration)**
**# A default version of this file can be fount at **///etc/i3status.conf//

== Getting Window Information ==
**# Should you change your applications and want information for key-binding etc**
**# Install the **//xorg-xprop//** package**
$ pacman -S xorg-xprop

**# Run **//xprop//** and watch your cursor turn into a corsair. Now click the Window you want information about.**
**# The **//WM_CLASS(STRING) = "Navigator", "Firefox" //**(etc) is probably what you are looking for.**

== Icons in Workspace bar ==
**# You should have the **//font-awesome//** package installed.**
**# A nice cheat-sheet for these icons can be found here **http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/
**# Then just copy the icon you'd like into the string in the configuration file.**

===== Saving & Restoring Workspace Layout =====
**# Requires **//perl-anyevent-i3//** and **//perl-json-xs//
$ pacman -S perl-anyevent-i3 perl-json-xs

== Save Workspace Layout ==
**# Navigate to the workspace **
**# Then open and arrange the programs the way you'd like it to be restore**
**# Then save that layout to a json file.**
**#** //N//** = workspace (numeric).**
$ i3-save-tree --workspace //N// > ~/dotfiles/.config/i3/layouts/workspace_//N//.json

**# Once the workspace files has been created, they need to be edited**
**# Open it with your favorite editor and look for the following **
	 "swallows": [
				   {
				   // "class": "",
				   // "instance": "",
				   // "title": "",
				   // "transient_for": ""
				   }
				]
	
**# We just need **//class//** and **//instance//** so remove the bottom two lines and comment out the two needed**
**# Also note the trailing , (comma) after **//instance//** - remove this too**
	 "swallows": [
		   {
			  "class": "",
			  "instance": ""
		]

**# Note, that the **//instance//** variable is for named windows. **
**# You could ex specify something like; **//"instance": "Special"//
**# Now only windows open with the name **//Special//** will correspond. Ex; **//urxvt -name Special//


== Load Workspace Layout ==
**# Once the workspace layout has been saved (as showed above), **
**# create a script that will load the layout and run the applications**
**# Change**// N//** accordingly; **//~/dotfiles/.config/i3/layouts/load_workspace_N.json//

	#!/bin/bash
	# First we append the saved layout to the workspace - Change //N// accordingly 
	i3-msg "workspace //N//; append_layout ~/dotfiles/.config/i3/layouts/workspace_//N//.json"
	
	# Then run the programs, Ex
	(urxvt &)
	(firefox &)
	(zim &)

**# Make the Shell files **executable
$ chmod u+x ~/.config/i3/layouts/load_layout_//N//.sh

**# You can now run the Shell scripts - or add them to your **//i3//** config**
