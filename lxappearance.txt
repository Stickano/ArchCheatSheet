====== lxappearance ======
Created mandag 19 december 2016

**Lxappearance will allow you to set a system wide font in gtk themed application etc.**
**One of the reason we use lxappearance, is to generate a couple of GTK files - Both for gtk-2 and gtk-3, which reads its configurations from different locations.**

== Installation ==
$ pacman -S lxappearance

== Running ==
**# You can run **//lxappearance //**to get the GUI controls. **

== Configuration ==
**# Changing a font value in lxappearance (and apply) will generate a couple of configs for gtk-2 and gtk-3.**
**# Fint them in **//~/.gtkrc-2.0 //**and **//~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini //**and change the font to your liking.**
