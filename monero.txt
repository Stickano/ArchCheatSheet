====== monero ======
Created l√∏rdag 17 december 2016

**Monero is a crypto currency, that we are still able to mine with our limping hardware^**
**Mine the monero currency and change them into BitCoin - That is the plan. **

== Installation ==
**# Can be found in the AUR**
$ yaourt -S bitmonero-git

== Syncing the blockchain ==
**# You need to import and sync the blockchain. **
$ monerod

**# It'll take some time^**
**# Once updated, leave the daemon running. **
**Good for the community and your wallet needs fully synced chain anyways (when running).**


== Creating your wallet ==
**# When creating a new wallet, you will be put through a configuration wizard for a password etc.**
$ mkdir ~/.monero_wallet
$ cd ~/.monero_wallet
$ monero-wallet-cli 

**# The monero wallet will start to refresh**
**# If it fails on its way, make sure the monerod (daemon) is running and enter **//refresh//** to start refreshing again.**

**# Once your wallet i refreshed, save it**
$ save

== Using your wallet ==
**# Start the monero daemon (needs to run in order for the wallet to work)**
$ monerod

**# and navigate to your wallet folder to run it **
$ cd ~/.monero_wallet
$ monero-wallet-cli

**# This will prompt your first to enter the name of your wallet (chosen in the conf-wizard)**
**# Then your password. Once succeeded, your wallet will be displayed. **

**# To view your public address**
$ address

**# To view your balance**
$ balance

**# To send money**
$ transfer //<address> <amount>//


===== Mining =====
**# To mine monero coins you'll have to mine with a pool. **
**# To first monero mining pools seems to have a 100% donation rate, which is nice.**
**# They take a little higher fee though (1.9%), but it goes to a good cause I guess.**
**# This pool can be found at **https://moneropool.com

**# You will also need a mining software **
**#** **(THIS IS A CPU MINER. There is also GPU miners)**
$ yaourt -S cpuminer-multi

**# To start mining**
$ cpuminer -a cryptonight -o stratum+tcp://mine.moneropool.com:3333 -u //<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>// -p x
