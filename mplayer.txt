== Creating and Playing playlists ==
**You can create a playlist by navigating to the directory where the intended files are stored. The run : **
$ find -maxdepth 1 -type f -name \*.//mkv// | sort > playlist

**This will create a sorted file called **//playlist//** with all the **//mkv// **files in the directory. **
**Change the **//mkv//** part if the file format differs. If files extension differs, you can use **//\*.*//
**To use the playlist, append the **//-playlist//** option : **
$ mplayer -playlist playlist

== Browser Integration ==
**Mplayer can control the video viewing in your browser. The **//gecko-mediaplayer//** package provides this feature for both Firefox and Chromium. The **//gecko-mediaplayer//** package depends on **//gnome-mplayer//** package, which is a GTK front end for mplayer.**

**# Install the two packages : **
$ pacman -S gnome-mplayer gecko-mediaplayer

== Resume from where you last left off ==
**There is a mplayer wrapper which can be invoked whenever you want to resume a move from where you last stopped.**

**Install the wapper 	**//mplayer-resumer// (AUR) **package** **and invoke it with **
$ mplayer-resumer //options path/to/file//

== Allowing Framedrops ==
**Allowing framedrops will increase fps on slower systems, but at the cost of quality. It'll allow a frame to be dropped here and there. To allow framedrops, run mplayer with the **//-framedrop //**option : **
$ mplayer -framedrop ///path/to/file//

== Watching streamed links ==
**You can use the **//-playlist//** option to play e.g. ASK links**
$ mplayer -playlist //link-to-stream.asx//

== Taking screenshots ==
**It is possible to take either a single sc or multiple sc's by appending the 	**//-vf screenshot //**option : **
$ mplayer -vf screenshot //filename.mkv//

**This will allow you to press 's' to take a single screenshot, or 'S' to take multiple screenshots until 'S' is pressed again.**
**The files (PNG) will be stored in the current working directory.**
