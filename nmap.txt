====== nmap ======
Created søndag 11 december 2016

== Installation ==
$ pacman -S nmap

===== Usage =====
**# Some basic usage for full blown mad-man, and the bit more discreet approaches.**

== Some basics - be aware that these might be easily spotted by FW/IDS ==
**# Scan for open ports (**//verbose//**), use double for extra verbose **//-vv//
$ nmap -v //host//

**# Get OS**
$ nmap -A <//host>//

**# To scan for a specific port on an entire network (**//-p//** to define port)**
**# Example for port 22, default SSH**
$ nmap -p 22 192.168.0.*		

**# Comprehensive scan**
**# **//-g 53 //**to use port 53 (**//DNS//**) which has better chance of being allowed**
$ nmap -sS -n -sU -T4 -A -v -PE -PP -PS -PA -PU -PY -g 53 //<host>//

**# Normal quick scan**
**# **//-T4 //**is pretty fast scan - you can use **//-T2//** to slow it down**
**# **//-n//** is no DNS resolution, and **//-Pn//** is to treat all hosts as online (skip host discovery) **
$ nmap -T4 -n -A -v -Pn //<host>//

**# We can check if the server is using packet filtering with **//-PN//
$ nmap -PN //<host>//

**# Check host and interface**
$ nmap --iflist //<host>//

**# Some firewalls blocks PING requests, check it with TCP ACK and Syn packets**
$ nmap -PS //<host>//

== Evading FW/IDS ==
**# Do **//ACK //**scan instead of the **//SYN//** scan**
$ nmap -sA <//host>//

**# nmap will produce one of the these four responses**
	Open port		**(few will be the case if encountered a FW)**
	Closed port	**(most ports are closed due to the FW)**
	Filtered		**(not able to determine if open or not)**
	Unfiltered		**(can access but is still uncertain if open or closed)**
	
**# In case of **//unfiltered//** you can try a **//TCP Window//** scan.**
**# Very similar to **//ACK//** but designed to diferentiate between open and closed ports**
$ nmap -sW <//host>//

**# Should give you **//Filtered//** or **//Closed//

**# You can also try and sent fragment packets with **//-f//
**# To further break down packets, use double **//-ff//
$ nmap -ff <//host>//

**# **//nmap//** allows you to spoof a random vendor MAC -**
**#** **This will make it hard to determine where the attack came from.**
**# **//nmap //**has a db with vendor prefixes, so whenever you provide a vendor, **
**#** **it looks in the db for a suitable MAC.**
$ nmap -spoof-mac Cisco <//host>//

**# Unit and value rules for the next two examples.**
	5ms** = 5milliseconds)**
	5s** = 5 seconds**
	5m **= 5 minutes**
	5h **= 5 hours**

**# To not stress a network, you can delay the scans - specialy effective on larger networks.**
$ nmap -scan_delay 5s //host//

**# Sometimes a host might take a long time to respond - can beøøø due to FW ex.**
**# If you don't want to waste your time, set a timelimit per host**
$ nmap -host-timeout 5s <//host>//

== Scripting ==
**# Scripts can be fount in **///usr/share/nmap/scripts///** and has the **//.nse //**extension.**
**# **//nmap//** has a shit-load of scripts - here is some of the best.**
**# **//-sV//** scans for apps on ports**

**# Check for vulnerabilities**
$ nmap -sV -script=smb-check-vulns <//host>//

**# This will check for one of the following vulnerabilities**
	MS08-067 Windows vulnerability that can be exploited
	Conficker malware on the target machine
	Denial of service vulnerability of Windows 2000
	MS06-025 Windows 
	MS07-029 Windows 

**# You can scan a website directory with **//http-enum//
**# This is also used to scan for open ports and the software with their version on each port**
$ nmap -sV -script=http-enum <//host>//

**# There is a Samba heap overflow vulnerability **//CVE-2012-1182//**, scan for it with the following**
$ nmap -script=samba-vuln-cve-2012-1182 -p 139 //<host>//

**# Alot of companies are not running their SMTP on the default port. **
**# **//smtp-strangeport //** is a script to determine if the SMTP is running on the standard port or not,**
$ nmap -sV -script=smtp-strangeport //<host>//

**# We can get the PHP version with **//http-php-version//
$ nmap -sV -script=http-php-version //<host>//

**# There is several WordPress scripts**
	http-wordpress-plugins
	http-wordpress-enum
	http-wordpress-brute
	
**# To find blacklisted IP addresses**
$ nmap -sn //<host> //-script=dns-blacklist
