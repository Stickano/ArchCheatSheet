Created Friday 30 December 2016

**By default, you aren't allowed to use the **//sudo//** command as a user. **
**Further more, running X applications with sudo is not possible by default.**
**This is because, that root does not have access to the primary screen by default.**

**# The sudoers configuration file is located at **///etc/sudoers//**. **
**# This file should always be edited with the visudo editor.** 
$ EDITOR=nano visudo

== Enable user to use sudo ==
**# Edit the sudoers file**
$ EDITOR=nano visudo

**# And add the user**
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
stick ALL=(ALL) ALL
}}}

	

== Allow sudo to use X applications ==
**# Edit **///etc/profile//** and add the following line - remember to change **//username//
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
export XAUTHORITY=/home/<username>/.Xauthority
}}}

{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
