**Further more, running X applications with sudo is not possible by default.**
**This is because, that root does not have access to the primary screen by default.**

**# The sudoers configuration file is located at **///etc/sudoers//**. **
**# This file should always be edited with the visudo editor.** 
$ EDITOR=nano visudo
